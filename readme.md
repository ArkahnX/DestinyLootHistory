# Destiny Loot History
Track your [Destiny](http://destinythegame.com/) inventory changes as they happen. With Destiny Loot History, your loot is **tracked automatically**, including **when and where** you acquired items. You can see their **stat quality** and **stat distribution**, and you can **filter data** to specific game types and times to **export**.

Stat score is [calculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4m417m/final_infusion_stat_calculator_from_200335_light/) automatically on all received items, with the ability to hover over the item to see its stat rolls and perks. You will also be able to see hidden stats such as aim assist and equip speed.

Have you ever wondered how old some of the items you have are? the `Item History` page has you covered! This page parses through all of your inventory and sorts unique items from oldest to newest. We have separations between each DLC and a few major non DLC releases, such as SRL and the April Update.
